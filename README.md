# PyBer_Analysis
The goal of this project to analyze data for Python-based ride sharing company by
creating visualizations of rideshare data for PyBer to help improve access to ride-sharing services and determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods. To this end, we will analyze data looking at cities in three categories: urban, suburban and rural.

## Results:
You'll notice the difference in the ride sharing data among the different city types via the chart below.
First, urban cities have the most total riders, total drivers and total fares. 
Rural cities have the lowest total rides, total drives and total fares. Suburban areas fall in between. 
What is important to note is that rural cities have the highest average fare per ride and over $34. 
Rural cities also have the highest average fare per driver among the city types at $55. 
Suburban areas have the second highest average fare per driver at $39.50.

## Summary:
Finally, on the chart "Total Fares by City Type", we've presented total fare data from January 2019 through April 2019. You'll see that urban cities have the highest total fares, followed by suburban types then rural cities.
Note that fares increase for all city types between February and March then spike again at the beginning of April. 
If this represents seasonal trends then we can make three recommendations based on the data:
1. Increaese the number of drivers in suburban areas in January through February when ridership in suburban areas increases, but decreases in urban cities.
2. Increase drivers for all city types at the end of February to handle increased demand.
3. Shift drivers from suburban cities to rural cities in April when demand increases in rural cities.
